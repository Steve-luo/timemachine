# Time Machine

This is a project responding to this social media era where everyone is using the same platform for communication. People are always staring at their digital devices, looking at the same websites, the same apps, yet the content is tailored to each individual user. 
This website synchronizes the screens across all devices visiting. But instead of targeted content, users are randomly assigned a video snippet of a childhood aniation show. The change happens at the same time for everyone. 

A Core Studio project at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
